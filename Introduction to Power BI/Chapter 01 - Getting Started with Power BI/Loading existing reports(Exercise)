Loading existing reports
Let's get you started! We provide you with your very own virtual machine running Power BI. It may take a few minutes to load, but it only needs to be set up once.

Before you start loading data and creating visualizations, it's important you know how to load existing reports. If at any point in the course you lose progress or get stuck, you can load the corresponding report to re-initialize. In this exercise, we'll take a look at a report you will be able to create by the end of this chapter.

All the reports used in this course are also available for download at the bottom right of the course page if you want to open them locally.


Instruciton:

1/5-Under File menu in Power BI, click on “Browse Reports” and open the report called 1_10_Making_Maps.pbix, from the Exercises folder on the desktop. It might take a while to load.
